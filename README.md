# IPR_PROJECT_1_IMPLEMENTATION
Repository consists of 3 ipynb files namely ShanghaiTech_partA,ShanghaiTech_partB and UCF-CC-50 which have been made to reproduce the results of -Crowd Counting with Deep Negative Correlation Learning paper.
The D-convNet-1 model has been implemented using the details given in the paper.
Results of the implemention are produced using the kaggle GPU.
The model architecture is same in both ShanghaiTech and UCF-CC-50 files, however since UCF-CC_50 dataset does not have training and testing part seperately given, 5-fold cross-validation has been used for the model
evaluation has mentioned in the paper.
